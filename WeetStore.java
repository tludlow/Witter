/**
 * I have made the decision to use an AVLTree as the primary data structure to store the data regarding Weets. The common operations have time complexities off:
 * Insert: O(logn)
 * Get: O(logn)
 * Remove: O(logn)
 * Search: O(logn)
 * 
 * These are very efficient operations for handling Weet data as having 1,000,000,000 weets would still take, in the worse case 30 operations to locate the weet.
 * Another benefit of using an AVLTree is that it maintains constant space complexity O(n) as the number of weets increases. This is good as it is scalable to mahy weets
 * with a predicatable size of space needed given a number of weets.
 * 
 * I have also used an ArrayList in implementing this store as a general method to hold a collection of data. This is used to store results of in-order tree traversals mainly.
